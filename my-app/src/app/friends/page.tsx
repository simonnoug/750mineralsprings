        This website by the friends of the 750 mineral springs of Greece features gatherings, activities and information. Friends perform acts of attention towards the maintenance and preservation of an overlooked natural resource and built cultural heritage. 
        A 1938 book publication by Nikolaos Lekkas titled “The 750 Mineral Springs of Greece” shows how the scientific analysis of mineral springs, rocks, and soil in Greece led to a new understanding of the country’s resources: its airs, waters and places. The wealth of mineral springs conveyed in the book presents an extraordinary imaginary of Greece: a geography centered around a healing network. Decades of numerous man-made activities- building, infrastructure works, state, municipal and private negligence- have greatly impacted them. 
        What exactly is their state  today? Are they even 750? We keep searching and looking closely.
        Friends gather in springs and Loutropolis (bath towns). We organize workshops, engage municipalities in conversation, publish texts, bathe, created unsolicited site specific art works and ephemeral architectural interventions. 
        We pay attention in order to imagine potential futures, away from the narratives of the luxury SPA exploitation and fast tourism consumption. Through actions and conversations we raise questions; we would like the springs and baths to remain accesible as sites of care for all. 
        Since 2024 "Friends of the 750 Mineral Springs of Greece" is a registered non-profit association (Verein) in Zurich.
